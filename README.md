# Dashboards
Dashboard construction using Python Dash and Plotly

This is an interactive Dashboard I created to get a better to the data for the Space Titanic competition on Kaggle.

To run it, download both the .py and the .csv files and place them in the same folder, then run the .py file in an python IDE,

The dashboard should become accessible using your browser on the http://127.0.0.1:8050/, otherwise it is the one written on your IDE console.
