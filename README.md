# Dashboards
Dashboard construction using Python Dash and Plotly

This is an interactive Dashboard I created to get a better to the data for the Space Titanic competition on Kaggle.

The dashboard should become accessible using your browser on the http://127.0.0.1:8050/, otherwise it is the one written on your IDE console.

The Jupyter notebook file was made to run on Google Colab, in case someone cannot run Python in their computer
